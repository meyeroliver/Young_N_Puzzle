# Young_N_Puzzle

The goal of this project is to solve a N-puzzle "sliding tile puzzle". To solve this problem I learnt about the A*
search algorithm. This is an efficient search algorithm that finds the best possible path between two points, but this
also depends on the heuristics use. This was a team project and the heuristics we decided to use were:
1) Misplaced tiles
2) Manhattan Distance
3) Rows and Columns

The goal of this project is to solve the N-puzzle game using the A* search algorithm or one of its variants.
You start with a square board made up of N*N cells. One of these cells will be empty,
the others will contain numbers, starting from 1, that will be unique in this instance of
the puzzle.

Your search algorithm will have to find a valid sequence of moves in order to reach the
final state, a.k.a the "snail solution/spiral solution"
